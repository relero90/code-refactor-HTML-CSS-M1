# code-refactor-HTML-CSS-M1

##About

This is a refactor of HTML and CSS code for a website for Horiseon Social Solution Services.

HTML code has been refactored to utilize semantic tags. Alt tags have been added for improved accessibility and search engine optimization.

CSS stylesheet has been consolidated and reorganized to follow the new semantic structure of the HTML.

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
